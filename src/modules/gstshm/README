GstSHM:

This links two or more melt processes over shm using the same synchronization
protocol of GStreamer to coordinate reads and writes.

It is based on the posixshm module written by Tomas Neme but aims to make Melt
and GStreamer play nice together. The depayloader for GStreamer will come soon.

Basic usage:

  Run:
    melt -producer count -consumer gstshm

  After that launch one or more of:
    melt -producer gstshm -consumer sdl # or something else...

The default control socket is located at /dev/shm/mlt.shm but can be changed
to have many consumers/producers with different content as shown:

    melt -consumer gstshm:/path/to/socket
    melt -producer gstshm:/path/to/socket

If the socket already exists when starting the consumer it is unlinked, old
consumers and producers using it (if any) will keep running but the following
will pick up audio and video from the new consumer.

If there is no consumer providing data when starting the producer it will fail.
However, if the consumer dies/quits/etc. the producer will wait for it to come
back and reconnect when that happens. Melt still responds to signals but the
keyboard commands are ignored until it reconnects. Patches are welcome.

Known limitations:

  - Using a consumer and producer on the same melt process doesn't work yet.
    This fails: melt -producer gstshm:socket1.shm -consumer gstshm:socket2.shm

  - Clutters the socket folder with temp files...
